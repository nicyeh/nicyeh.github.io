### WHAT:  
a fully automated, user-friendly syringe pump that can be manufactured at a low cost.
### WHY:  
this simple but effective device is essential to the healthcare industry. If needed, this design can be replicated quickly for emergency/low cost use.
### HOW:  
basic components (stepper motor, lead screw, potentiometer, Arduino) used in a cohesive design in combination with 3D printed pieces.

### Skills developed:  
CAD & dimensioned drawings (Fusion 360), programming (C++), wiring & soldering, iterative design

### Features include:  
* Nema 17 stepper motor coupled to an 8mm lead screw
* custon 3D printed PLA syringe holders driven by the stepper motor on the lead screw
* 200 mm linear rod to stabilize syringe pump
* Latching button to start, pause, and resume actuation
* Potentiometer that adjusts flow rate (0.08 to 4 mL per min)
* LED to indicate syringe state (full, paused, empty)
* LCD showing flow rate and time until empty
* Limit switch used to stop actuation when syringe is empty
* Arduino Uno and A4988 stepper driver controlling stepper motor from inputs
* powered by Mean Well RQ-65D AC-DC power supply
* custom 3D printed PLA base with a sliding lid, enclosing all electrical components
