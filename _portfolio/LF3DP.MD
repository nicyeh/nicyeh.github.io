## Skateboard deck

## About the Design
In the pursuit of designing a large-format 3D printed skateboard deck, my primary objective was to seamlessly marry the comfort associated with a classic skateboard deck's curved design with the feasibility of 3D printing. The challenge lay in balancing the ergonomic requirements for a comfortable ride with the constraints imposed by the 3D printing process.

The foundation of the design emanated from the desire to incorporate a curved shape, reminiscent of traditional skateboard decks, ensuring a comfortable and familiar riding experience. However, the innovation lay in the meticulous consideration given to the 3D printing aspects. To optimize the printing process, I meticulously accounted for the orientation of the design, ensuring that no overhang exceeded 45 degrees. This thoughtful approach to orientation not only enhanced the printability of the deck but also minimized the need for support structures during the printing process.

Drawing inspiration from the classic skateboard design, which facilitates both easy riding and the execution of tricks, I integrated kick tails on either end of the board. This not only adhered to the conventional skateboard design but also added a functional element for performing maneuvers. The kick tails serve as a nod to the versatile nature of skateboarding, allowing for both cruising and trick-oriented riding styles.

In terms of dimensions, the deck was endowed with a thickness of 0.7 inches, a carefully considered compromise between conflicting factors. A thinner profile contributes to a lighter and more maneuverable deck, enhancing the overall agility of the skateboard. Simultaneously, a slightly thicker profile was introduced to impart stability to the board, striking a delicate balance that caters to the divergent preferences of skateboard enthusiasts.

This large-format 3D printed skateboard deck embodies a harmonious convergence of classic design principles and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques. The meticulous consideration of the 3D printing intricacies ensures a seamless translation of the envisioned design into a tangible, functional deck that not only pays homage to skateboarding tradition but also explores the possibilities afforded by additive manufacturing.


## Full Assembly
Following is the CAD assembly of the LF3DP skateboard deck, generative design trucks, motors, gears, and wheels. This model was intended to be printed on the Form 3+ pritner using resin, but due to some unforseen issues and time constraints it was uanble to be completed. Sorry David!
