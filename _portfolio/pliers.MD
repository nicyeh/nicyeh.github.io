Print-in-place is a method of 3D printing that creates a complete, moveable part right off of the print bed. Multiple components are printed in their assembled configuration, allowing for complicated products to be created quickly and with little waste. Other print-in-place objects include hinges, articulating toys, and latching mechanisms.

This pair of print-in-place pliers was created as four separate components made of PLA and TPU. Due to a lack of availabiltiy of the dual-extruder printer, This design was produced in separate prints separated by material and was subsequently assembled. However, this print can easily be modified and printed all at once on a dual extruder.
