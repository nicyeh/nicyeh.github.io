### WHAT:  
a phone holder that securely mounts on bike handlebars and can display phone vertically or horizontally.
### WHY:  
need a quick and reliable way to hold and view smartphone while riding a bike.
### HOW:  
four components modeled in a top-down assembly and 3D printed with PLA, fastened with screws and heat set inserts.

## Skills developed:  
CAD (Fusion 360), top-down modeling, 3D printing, iterative design

## Top-Down Modeling
  This design was created in Fusion360 with a top-down modeling approach. This method of design is helpful to quickly make simple assemblies that share measurements between components and fit closely together. For this assembly, I parameterized the handlebar diameter, holder minimum and maximum positions, and the thickness of all of the pieces. Other features like the slideing rails in the claw grips and the indents and bumps where the mount attaches to the holder were extruded from the same sketch onto separate components, saving time and simplifying the timeline.
## Design Rationale
This phone holder and mount was designed for strength, ease of use, and printability.
The handlebar mount consists of two components, one enclosing most of the bar and a flat second piece that is screwed into the first with two M3x12 screws. This second, flat piece has an extrusion on the outside that encloses an M5 heat set insert. Because of the first piece's curved base and large overhang, it is printed on its side. The second piece has more intricate features on the top and utilizes its flat base to be printed in its normal orientation.
The phone holder also is made of two components, one base and one attachment. The larger portion, or base of the holder, contains an M5 counterbore hole that holds the head of an M5x25 screw and allows it to be attached securely to the flat mount piece. The larger portion of the holder consists of only one side of the claw grip. In order for these pieces to seamlessly mesh, there are two rails extending from the small side of the grip and corresponding holes in the base holder. This, in combination with an M5x30 screw going through the small holder and fastening into the larger one, allows the grips to open and close depending on the tightening of the screw. This tightening screw was made easier to turn without tools with a compression-fit 3D printed knob around its head
## Assembly
To mount this on a bike, take the round semicircle piece and place it around the handlebars. Screw the flat piece over the other side of the handlebars with two M3x12 screws. Use an M5x25 screw to attach the base of the holder to the previous flat piece, and make sure that the holder is locked into one of the two orientations through the interlocking bumps. This screw can later be loosened to change the orientation of the phone. Assemble the holder by putting the rails of the second half of the holder into the corresponding holes and screw in the screw with a knob. Finally, open the grips enough to slide your phone into the grips. Tighten the screw until the phone is securely held in place
## Material Choice
PLA was used for this project becuase of its ease of printing and all around strong properties. Printing with this material ensured a rigid yet light structure that was easy to print and reprint over the five iterations of the design.
